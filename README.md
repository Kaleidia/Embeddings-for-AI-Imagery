# Embeddings-for-AI-Imagery
This is an assortment of textural inversions or embeddings I created over the last few years for sdxl and other models. They are labeled with their base model version and should work on those. The sd based models were created with the EmbeddingMerge Plugin of A1111 and the T5 versions on ComfyUI.
