# Embeddings-for-AI-Imagery
This is an assortment of textural inversions or embeddings I created over the last few years for sdxl and other models. They are labeled with their base model version and should work on those. The sd based models were created with the EmbeddingMerge Plugin of A1111 and the T5 versions on ComfyUI.

The nodes for ComfyUI can be found here: https://github.com/silveroxides/ComfyUI_EmbeddingToolkit

There are a few general embeddings like detailers and nsfw changers as well as some character embeddings with interpretations of some video game character and some oc characters I created over the years. They will be sorted into folders for their usage and categories.
